# 🥚 Simple Omelette Recipe Page

This is a clean and responsive **Recipe Page** built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It is based on a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge that showcases a recipe for a classic omelette.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure a full-page recipe layout using semantic HTML elements.
- Usage of `:root` and CSS custom properties for consistent theming.
- Organizing sections with proper spacing using Flexbox and media queries.
- Styling ordered and unordered lists with custom marker colors.
- Using `border-collapse` and `last-child` selectors to style tables cleanly.
- How to make layouts mobile-responsive with `max-width` and media queries.
- Incorporating Google Fonts (`Young Serif` and `Outfit`) for typography hierarchy.
- Using `min-height` to ensure full viewport coverage and consistent layout on tall screens.
